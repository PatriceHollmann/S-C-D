/**
 * 
 * This exporter class creates an XLSX file that has 2 sheets:
 * 
 * - one sheet that has the pivot table
 * - one sheet that has the raw data
 * 
 * To be able to correctly export the pivot table definition to Excel you need to ensure that:
 * 
 * - only the following aggregator functions are used: min, max, avg, count, variance, varianceP, stdDev and stdDevP
 * - the pivot matrix provided should be Ext.pivot.matrix.Local
 * 
 * This exporter can be used together with the Ext.pivot.plugin.Exporter.
